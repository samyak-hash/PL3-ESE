                        Many of us who work in the computing industry, quickly realize, that technical skills are just one part of this competitive game. Softer aspects such as design and communication skills are all just as critical. A popular perception is that creativity has not been sufficiently noticeable in the Indian software space – though this is gradually changing. It is relatively easy to find good programmers in India, but not so easy to find good designers or product visionaries. In 2005, Microsoft CTO, Craig Mundie remarked to Business Standard: ” (Indian) Computer engineers are more into theory .. There are so few Indian software companies developing local software.. a negative reinforcement, because there is no local software and no new applications”.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        A possible reason for this lack of creativity, is the near absence of liberal arts education and the presence of unhealthy levels of homogeneity in the academic background,  among Indian software professionals. A disproportionate number of us studied the standard Physics – Chemistry – Mathematics (PCM) combination in high school, followed by a STEM degree. Few with a Commerce or Humanities background study Computer Science. The liberal arts component of a STEM degree in India, is minimal; often not even 10% of the credit requirement. In a rigorous American tech institute such as Caltech, around a quarter of undergraduate credit requirements are allocated for humanities.

                        We understand that there are a lot of enthusiastic programmers out there, who might not be Computer Science majors, but greatly interested in this field. This blog is partly in response to the requests of those who e-mailed us, asking for tutorials and guidance about how Non-CS majors could get started with Programming and Computer Science.
                        We’d like HackerRank to be a zone which can be a significant component of your self-learning experience. We’d also like to make suggestions and guide you as you explore Computer Science and Programming. This is very easy in this age of online courses, its equally easy to get lost and confused since the problem at hand is one of too much choice. Effective programming isn’t just about cranking out code, it also involves a strong understanding of Computer Science fundamentals, and for anyone aspiring to excel in this field, here are a few topics and subjects which you must know.

                        <h1>Data Structure And Algorithms</h1>
                        <ul>
                            <li>The use of routine Data Structures such as Arrays, Lists, Stacks, Queues, Trees and Graphs.</li>
                            <li>Basic Algorithms for common tasks such as sorting and searching.</li>
                            <li>Tweaking around and building more complex data structures, as required. It is unlikely that a complex task can be solved using just one simple data structure.</li>
                            <li>This might be difficult, but given that we currently live in an era of parallelism and multi-cores, a good understanding of parallel data structures and algorithms is important. The standard 1-Processor algorithm should be understood as the base case of these parallel algorithms.</li>
                            <li>Designing and analyzing algorithms, their complexity and their lower and upper bounds.</li>
                            <li>Different algorithmic approaches: Divide and Conquer, Dynamic Programming, Greedy Algorithms</li>
